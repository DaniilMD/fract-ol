# fract-ol
## Project objective
This project is the opporunity to hone skills to use a graphics library (miniLibX in this case), to discover/use the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics.  
## Skills to acquire and use
•	Fundamentals of C  
•	Algorithm elaboration  
•	Imperative programming  
•	Rigor  
•	Graphics 
## How to run it? (works on MacOS)
•	git clone https://github.com/DaniilMD/fract-ol.git «Folder name»  
•	cd «Folder name»  
•	make  
•	run the program using executable "fractol" and a fractol number as an argument. (Number 1 -  Julia, 2 - Mandelbrot, 3 - Burningship)  
For example:  
```
./fractol 1
```
